## Font naming

### File names

All installed fonts use a file naming scheme of:

    Family [Variant] WeightValue [Style].EXT

Uninstalled fonts use a file naming scheme of:

    Family[Variant]-WeightValue[-Style].EXT

Variant, if present, will be along the lines of “Rounded” or “Sketch”.

Style, if present, will typically be “Italic”, although others are possible.

Weights are one of:

    100    Thin
    200    Extra-light
    300    Light
    400    Regular (Book)
    500    Medium
    600    Semibold
    700    Bold
    800    Extra-bold
    900    Black

By preference, OpenType (`.otf`) files are installed.

### PostScript names

The _Font name_ uses a naming scheme of:

    Family[Variant]-Weight-[Style]

The _Family name_ uses a naming scheme of:

    Family Variant

The _Name for humans_ uses a naming scheme of:

    Family [Variant] Weight [Style]

### TrueType Font (TTF) names

The _Family_ should match the PostScript _Family name_.

The _Styles (sub-family)_ uses a naming scheme of:

    Weight [Style]

The _Fullname_ should match the PostScript _Name for humans_.

### Open Font License Reserved Names

Modifications to the fonts, including converting file formats, constitute a
“Modified Version” under the terms of the SIL Open Font License, and as such
must not use the “Reserved Font Name” (specified by the author when it was
released) as the primary name displayed to end-users.
